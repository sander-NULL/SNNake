# Snake Game and Neural Network Training in Python

This project implements the classic game of Snake in Python and explores two different approaches to training a neural network to play the game effectively. 

## Snake Game Implementation

The Snake game is implemented using Python's Pygame library. Players control the snake using arrow keys, attempting to eat food to grow longer while avoiding collision with walls or the snake's own body. This was inspired by [https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/](https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/).

## Neural Network Training

### a) Evolutionary Algorithm

One approach to training the neural network involves using an evolutionary algorithm. This method involves evolving a population of neural network models over multiple generations, with selection and mutation operations driving the optimization process. Through this approach, the neural network gradually learns to play the game more effectively based on its performance in each generation. This is implemented in [train_evol.py](train_evol.py).

### b) Backpropagation with PyTorch

The second approach utilizes backpropagation with the PyTorch library and is implemented in [train_backprop.py](train_backprop.py). This method involves training the neural network using a supervised learning paradigm, where the network learns from a dataset of input-output pairs generated by the [gen_tt_data.py](gen_tt_data.py) module. This module generates both training and test data.

## Getting Started

To run the Snake game and train the neural network, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Snake game using `python3 snake.py`.
4. Explore the different training methods by running the corresponding Python scripts.
5. Run `python3 sNNake.py` to see the resulting neural network playing.
