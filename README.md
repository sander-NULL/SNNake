# What
This trains an artificial neural network through an evolutionary alogrithm.

# Why
For my own fun and education.

# How to get started
I rewrote the classical game of snake in [snake.py](snake.py) with the help of [https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/](https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/).
The network is trained with [sNNake_train.py](sNNake_train.py).
The result can be seen with [sNNake.py](sNNake.py)
